Some Agda Hacking Lore. 


* Whenever you change the interface file format you should update
  Agda.TypeChecking.Serialise.currentInterfaceVersion.

* When a new feature is implemented it should be documented in
  doc/release-notes/<next-version>.txt. It is also a good idea to add
  test cases under test/succeed and test/fail, and maybe also
  test/interaction.

* Please use __IMPOSSIBLE__ instead of calls to error. __IMPOSSIBLE__
  generates errors of the following form:

   An internal error has occurred. Please report this as a bug.
   Location of the error: ...

  Calls to error can make Agda fail with an error message in the *ghci*
  buffer.
