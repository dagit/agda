-- Release notes for Agda 2 version 2.2.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important changes since 2.2.4:

Language
--------

* The horizontal tab character (U+0009) is no longer treated as white
  space.

* Multiple constructors, record fields, postulates or primitives can
  now be declared using a single type signature:

    data Bool : Set where
      false true : Bool

    postulate
      A B : Set

Tools
-----

* Syntax highlighting files for Emacs (.agda.el) are no longer used.
  The --emacs flag has been removed.

* If a file F is loaded, and this file defines the module M, it is now
  an error if F is not the file which defines M according to the
  include path.

  Note that the command-line tool and the Emacs mode define the
  meaning of relative include paths differently: the command-line tool
  interprets them relative to the current working directory, whereas
  the Emacs mode interprets them relative to the root directory of the
  current project. (As an example, if the module A.B.C is loaded from
  the file <some-path>/A/B/C.agda, then the root directory is
  <some-path>.)

* Type-checking is no longer done when an up-to-date interface exists.
  (Previously the initial module was always type-checked.)

* Emacs mode: C-c C-x C-d no longer resets the type checking state.
  C-c C-x C-r can be used for a more complete reset. C-c C-x C-s
  (which used to reload the syntax highlighting information) has been
  removed. C-c C-l can be used instead.
