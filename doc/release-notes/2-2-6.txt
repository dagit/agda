-- Release notes for Agda 2 version 2.2.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important changes since 2.2.4:

Language
--------

* Multiple constructors, record fields, postulates or primitives can
  now be declared using a single type signature:

    data Bool : Set where
      false true : Bool

    postulate
      A B : Set

Tools
-----

* If a file F is loaded, and this file defines the module M, it is now
  an error if F is not the file which defines M according to the
  include path.

  Note that the command-line tool and the Emacs mode define the
  meaning of relative include paths differently: the command-line tool
  interprets them relative to the current working directory, whereas
  the Emacs mode interprets them relative to the root directory of the
  current project. (As an example, if the module A.B.C is loaded from
  the file <some-path>/A/B/C.agda, then the root directory is
  <some-path>.)

* Emacs mode: C-c C-x C-d no longer resets the type checking state.
  C-c C-x C-r can be used for a more complete reset.
