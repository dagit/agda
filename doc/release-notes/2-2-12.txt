-- Release notes for Agda 2 version 2.2.12
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important changes since 2.2.10:

Language
--------

* When the --without-K flag is used literals are now treated as
  constructors.

* Dependent irrelevant function types.

  Non-dependent function types .A -> B are completed by their dependent
  counterpart.

    .(x y : A) -> B    .{x y z : A} -> B
    forall x .y -> B   forall x .{y} {z} .v -> B

  A declaration

    f : .(x : A) -> B
    f x = t

  means that x is irrelevant in t and in B.  This is possible e.g. if
  B : .A -> Set.  Dependent irrelevance allows us to define the eliminator
  for the Squash type:

    record Squash (A : Set) : Set where
      constructor squash
      field
        .proof : A

    ElimSq = {A : Set}(P : Squash A -> Set)
             (ih : .(a : A) -> P (squash a)) ->
             (a- : Squash A) -> P a-
    elimSq : ElimSq
    elimSq P ih (squash a) = ih a

  Note that this would not type-check with (ih : (a : A) -> P (squash a)).

* Unused Agdalight legacy syntax (x y : A; z v : B) for telescopes removed.

* Unsolved meta variables of a declaration now are frozen after type checking
  meaning they cannot be instantiated by following declarations.  For example

    one : Nat
    one = _

    bla : one â‰¡ suc zero
    bla = refl

  leads to an error now.  Up to 2.2.10, it lead to instantiation of _ to
  (suc zero).  If you want the old behavior back, put the two declarations
  into a mutual block; metas are only frozen at the end of a mutual block.

  Before entering interactive editing, all metas are unfrozen, such that
  the user can fill holes interactively.  Note that type checking for 
  interactively given terms is not perfect, so, Agda might refuse to reload
  a file even though it did not complain during interactive construction.
  This is because certain checks (positivity, termination, precise scoping)
  are only invoked upon reload, not upon give.

Tools
-----

* Using the --dependency-graph=FILE flag, it is now possible to generate a Dot
  file containing a graph over module dependencies. The generated file will
  be saved to the file FILE, which can be rendered using a tool like dot.

* The "make install" command no longer installs Agda globally (by
  default).
