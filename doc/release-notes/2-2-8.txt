-- Release notes for Agda 2 version 2.2.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important changes since 2.2.6:

Language
--------

* Automatic injectivity of type constructors has been disabled (by
  default). To enable it, use the flag --injective-type-constructors,
  either on the command line or in an OPTIONS pragma. Note that this
  flag makes Agda anti-classical and possibly inconsistent:

    Agda with excluded middle is inconsistent

  See test/succeed/InjectiveTypeConstructors.agda for an example.

Tools
-----

* Command which shows module contents: Given a module name M the Emacs
  mode can now display all the top-level modules and names inside M,
  along with types for the names. The command is activated using
  C-cÂ C-o or the menus.
