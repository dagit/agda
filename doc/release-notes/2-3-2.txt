-- Release notes for Agda 2 version 2.3.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important changes since 2.3.0:

Language
========

* New: Built-in irrelevance axiom.

    import Level

    postulate
      .irrAxiom : ∀ {a}{A : Set a} → .A → A
    {-# BUILTIN IRRAXIOM irrAxiom #-}

* Irrelevant projections require irrelevance axiom.

  Record with irrelevant fields now require the built-in IRRAXIOM
  (unless --no-irrelevant-projections).

    record Squash {a}(A : Set a) : Set a where
      constructor squash
      field
        .unsquash : A

  This will produce an irrelevant projection

    .unsquash : ∀ {a}{A : Set a} → Squash A → A
    unsquash (squash x) = irrAxiom x

  Thus, Agda will check for the built-in irrAxiom to be defined.

Compiler backends
=================

Tools
=====

Emacs mode
----------

* Asynchronous Emacs mode.

  One can now use Emacs while a buffer is type-checked. If the buffer
  is edited while the type-checker runs, then syntax highlighting will
  not be updated when type-checking is complete.

* Interactive syntax highlighting.

  The syntax highlighting is updated while a buffer is type-checked.
  This interactive highlighting is currently rather crude, it just
  marks that a piece of code is being type-checked, or has been
  type-checked.

* The Emacs mode now presents information about which module is
  currently being type-checked.

* New semantics of and default value for agda2-ghci-options.

  This change should affect very few users.

  Previously the options in agda2-ghci-options were activated using
  GHCi's :set command, now they are instead used as command-line
  arguments (prepended to haskell-ghci-program-args).

  The default value of this option has also changed: the
  -ignore-dot-ghci flag has been added.
