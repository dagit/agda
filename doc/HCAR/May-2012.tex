Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language (developed
using Haskell). A central feature of Agda is inductive families, i.e.\
GADTs which can be indexed by \emph{values} and not just types. The
language also supports coinductive types, parameterized modules, and
mixfix operators, and comes with an \emph{interactive} interface---the
type checker can assist you in the development of your code.

A lot of work remains in order for Agda to become a full-fledged
programming language (good libraries, mature compilers, documentation,
etc.), but already in its current state it can provide lots of fun as
a platform for experiments in dependently typed programming.

% TODO: Write something about what we're up to at the moment.
