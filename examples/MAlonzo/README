Usage

agda --compile --malonzo --malonzodir <DIR> --ghc-flag "<GHC FLAGS>" <FILE>.agda

Compiles <FILE>.agda and hereditarily imported agda files to Haskell
and to an executable.

Haskell files are written under the directory <DIR>/MAlonzo.
If --manlonzodir <DIR> is omitted, the current directory is used instead.
Agda module A.B.C translates to Haskell module MAlonzo.A.B.C
(to avoid conflicts between Agda and Haskell standard libraries.)

Those haskell files are then compiled to object files and an executable
by the command

ghc <GHC FLAGS> -i<DIR> -main-is MAlonzo.<FILE> <DIR>/Malonzo/<FILE>.hs --make

It is assumed that <FILE>.agda contains a definition of main :: IO ().
If it does not, ghc finishes with an error, but never mind.


In order to actually perform any side-effects, use the FFI, or the IO
module from the standard library.
