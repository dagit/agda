* agda1to2 -----------------------------------------------------------

'agda1to2' is a translator from a program in Agda 1 to its
coressponding program in Agda 2

At the current moments, it is rather a helper for translating by hand.
(Please don't expect it to be a perfect tool :)

* usage --------------------------------------------------------------

  $ agda1to2 foo.alfa > foo.agda

foo.alfa is a program in Agda 1 (new syntax).  foo.agda is the output
expected to be program in Agda 2.

  $ agda1to2 --old foo.alfa > foo.agda

In this case, foo.alfa is expected to be written in Agda 1 old syntax.
(but I don't check that.)
