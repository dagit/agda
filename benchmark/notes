20110629: after new level representation and optimised positivity check
          (used interface file for monad example)

20110701: actually type checking the monad example

20110706: (15:00) better precision in ArgsCmp constraints (avoiding rechecking
          the first arguments)

20110822: (13:30) switched compareArgs to compareElim (without getting rid of
          projection arguments). 1 second faster on monad and 1.5 seconds
          faster on monadpostulate, not sure why.

20110823: Got rid of projection arguments. Cut the monad examples in half, but
          no effect on prim which is kind of odd since ... oh we're using a
          datatype in prim. Changing that to a record and rerunning.

20110823: (08:00) Sigma record in prim and added all projections instead of
          just the first three.

20110825: Allow instantiation of blocked terms, and short-cut instantiation of
          metas.

20110830: New computer.

20110830: (18:00) Added patternmatch test case. Needs abnormal amounts of
          memory. No idea why.
