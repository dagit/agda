20110629: after new level representation and optimised positivity check
          (used interface file for monad example)

20110701: actually type checking the monad example

20110706: (15:00) better precision in ArgsCmp constraints (avoiding rechecking
          the first arguments)

20110822: (13:30) switched compareArgs to compareElim (without getting rid of
          projection arguments). 1 second faster on monad and 1.5 seconds
          faster on monadpostulate, not sure why.
