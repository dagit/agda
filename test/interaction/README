Test framework for interactions
-------------------------------

- 'make interaction' runs the interaction tests (also part of 'make test')
- Each test consists of an agda file SomeTest.agda and a interaction
  script SomeTest.in. The interaction script contains interactions (as
  commands to ghci) that should be performed on the Agda file.
- A simple example:
    top_command    (cmd_goals currentFile)
    goal_command 0 (cmd_goal_type_context Normalised) ""
    goal_command 0 cmd_give "s z"
    goal_command 0 cmd_give "Nothing"
  The Agda file is loaded automatically before running the test script
  and the variable currentFile is bound to the current file name (needed
  by cmd_goals, for instance).
- Two new functions have been added to Agda.Interaction.GhciTop for
  convenience:
    top_command  :: Interaction -> IO ()
    goal_command :: InteractionId -> GoalCommand -> String -> IO ()
- The default scope for the script is
  Agda.Interaction.GhciTop and Agda.Interaction.BasicOps, but more modules
  can be added with ':mod +Agda.Some.Other.Module'.
- The ghci output from each test is recorded in SomeTest.out and compared
  against for each run of the test.
