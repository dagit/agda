Test framework for interactions
-------------------------------

- 'make interaction' runs the interaction tests (also part of 'make test')
- Each test consists of an agda file SomeTest.agda and a interaction
  script SomeTest.in. The interaction script contains interactions (as
  commands to the Agda2 interpreter) that should be performed on the Agda
  file.
- A simple example:
    top_command    (cmd_load currentFile [])
    goal_command 0 (cmd_goal_type_context Normalised) ""
    goal_command 0 cmd_give "s z"
    goal_command 0 cmd_give "Nothing"
  The variable currentFile is bound to the current file name.
- Two macros are available for convenience: currentFile, top_command and goal_command.
  "currentFile" is replaced by the current file path by sed in the Makefile.
          top_command <command>
  is replaced by
          ioTCM currentFile None <command>
  and
          goal_command <i> <goalcommand> <s>
  is the same as
          ioTCM currentFile None <goalcommand> <i> noRange <s>
- The output from each test is recorded in SomeTest.out and compared
  against for each run of the test.
